I have a module with the following information, 
name: <module> version: <version>,  also I have this json information <cve-description> about the cve:  <cve-id>.
This json information provides the module and versions that are vulnerable to this CVE 
so if the version number matches or is in the range of a module version that is in the 
json file the cve is going to be vulnerable to the CVE.  You can only return true or false values
